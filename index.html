<button class="accordion">What are the fees?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <br/> Initial (55 minutes): $110 
    <br/>Reviews (30 mins): $80 
     <br/> Cancellation less than 24 hours before the appointment: 50% of the session cost 
      <br/>If you feel that we have lots to talk about you can always book an initial (even if it isn’t your first session) 
    </p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">What is a dietitian?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <br/> As per Dietitians Australia: 
    <br/>“Accredited Practising Dietitians (APDs) are university-qualified professionals that undertake ongoing training and education programs to ensure that they are your most up-to-date and credible source of nutrition information. They translate scientific health and nutrition information into practical advice, and practise in line with DAA Professional Standards.
    <br/>By seeing a dietitian you can have peace of mind that you are talking to someone who has the training and knows their stuff. </p>
</div>

      <button class="accordion">Do I need special technology for an online appointment ?</button>
      <div class="panel ">
        <p>
          <br/> You need a device (computer, tablet or phone) with access to the internet and a camera.
          <br/> You can use your device's microphone but I find we can hear each other better if you use headphones with an inbuilt microphone. 
          <br/> If you don’t have a device with a camera we can arrange a phone consult.
          <br/> At your appointment time, if you don’t appear in the online meeting, I will just call you and either sort out the problem or continue by telephone.
          </p>
      </div>
  
      <button class="accordion">Do I need a referral?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <br/> No, you don’t need a referral to make an appointment but you may need one to be eligible for a rebate for the session. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I eligible for a medicare rebate?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <br/> In order to get a rebate from medicare you need a chronic disease management plan also know as an EPC.
          <br/>  The current medicare rebate for dietitians is $54.60 per session
          <br/>  Please contact your GP to find out if you are eligible and ensure that the referral is made out to me 
          </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I eligible for a private health insurance rebate?</button>
      <div class="panel ">
        <p>
          <br/> If you have private health insurance ‘extras cover’ you may be eligible for a rebate. 
          <br/> Contact your private health provider to check if you are covered and if Telehealth appointments are included </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Do I need to prepare anything before the session?</button>
      <div class="panel ">
        <p>
          <br/>In preparation for our appointment it is a good idea to have think about what you normally eat - some people have an easy time recalling their day to day eating and others find it helpful to keep a food diary.  
          <br/> I recommend testing out zoom and your tech prior to the session to make the most of our appointment time.  
          <br/> Finally, write down any questions you have  so that we can discuss them during the session. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">How do I pay</button>
      <div class="panel ">
        <p>You will see different appointment options when you book:
         <br/> 1.	Book an appointment with online payment: You will be asked for your card details when booking. Your card will be charged automatically when our session starts. There is a transaction fee of 1.9% (of the session cost) + $1.00.
         <br/> 2.	Book an appointment with bank transfer: Pay via bank transfer prior to the day using my PayID (0411225400). Money must be transferred 24 hour prior to the appointment of your appointment may be cancelled. No transaction fee applies
